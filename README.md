### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently working on several projects :
  - 3D engine on a Numworks calculator, using the built-in Python app;
  - a text-based RPG, named "rpg_test" for obvious reasons, in Python;
  - finishing a game jam project in Unity: a kind of Grind-Craft-Magic FPS?;
  - a scrapped and deleted project, but still: a modern rendition of the Thunder Force series, in Unity;
  - creating a game for the Megadrive, compatible with the real hardware;
  - to do the last item, I am currently learning C before getting to grips with the MD's limitations!
